   Tucson 1940-2010 Model Information File - April 2013
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The updated 1940-2010 Tucson AMA Groundwater Flow Model contains 
several improvements over the perviously released model.  General model 
improvements are detailed in ADWR's Modeling Report No. 24.  Suggestions 
to model users are detailed below.  The model input and output files
are provided in separate folders.  

Notes to Modelers:

* The model was been developed using MODFLOW-NWT Version 1.0.7.

* The model was as designed will run in a DOS command window. The MODFLOW 
  input files can be imported into model software pre-preocessors, or can
  be run in DOS using the latest version of MODFLOW-NWT.

* Two solvers, gmres1.nwt and xmd1.nwt, are included in the model input
  folder.  Model results are virtually identical when using either solver.
  
* Several model input data sets have been updated as problems within 
  the model input data have been found.  New and/or updated data has 
  been included in the constant head (CHD), well (WEL), and recharge
  (RCH) packages.  Some cleanup has also been in the Basic  (BAS) 
  and Upstream Weighting (UPW) packages.
  
Thanks to all those who have rummaged through the data and found problems
and have been kind enough to pointed them out to the Department.
