Run tests as:
    python ./test_optimization_server_ga.py or
    python ./test_optimization_server_simplex.py or
    python ./test_stop_optimization.py or 

Optimization responses are simply printed, no response validation is performed.
All tests use the same optimization_id, so avoid running a second test untill the first is not finished or stopped.
